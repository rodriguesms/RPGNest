# RPGNest Project

## Introduction

This is a Spring Boot application for the development of a Management System of Virtual Tabletop RPG Campaigns. 

The Backend is being conceived in Spring Boot while the Frontend should be created using React.

At this point, there are some options being considered, like the building of a Web App, or a Desktop App, or even a Mobile App. There is nothing defined until now.

Some features to do:

* User:
    * Create a campaign and invite other users to join.
    * The creator of a campaign shall be the Game Master, while the inviters are the Players.
