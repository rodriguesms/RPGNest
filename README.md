# RPGNest Project

## Introduction

This is an application for the development of a Management System of Virtual Tabletop RPG Campaigns. 

At this moment, there are some options being considered, like the building of a Web App, or a Desktop App, or even a Mobile App. There is nothing defined until now. Maybe all of them. Qt using C++ may be useful at this point.

The whole point of this project isn't just about the application development, but also my growth as a problem solver. My career goal, at least now, is to become a Software Engineer, to build products that could solve problems. Now, what I want to do is enjoy the obtained university knowledge and use it to build solutions. 

As I was saying, C++ may be useful, followed by Java, because of it's performance benefit.

This is a project for my free time. Considering that i'm in the end of a university semester, im pretty busy right now, so this project must wait a litte bit. I will be back in a few days. 

Some features to do:
