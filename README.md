# RPGNest Project

## Introduction

This is a Spring Boot application for the development of a Management System of Virtual Tabletop RPG Campaigns. 

The Backend is being conceived in Spring Boot.

At this point, there are some options being considered, like the building of a Web App, or a Desktop App, or even a Mobile App. There is nothing defined until now. Maybe all of them. Qt using C++ may be useful at this point.

This is a project for my free time. Considering that i'm in the end of a university semester, im pretty busy right now, so this project must wait a litte bit. I will be back in a few days. 

Some features to do:

* User:
    * Create a campaign and invite other users to join.
    * The creator of a campaign shall be the Game Master, while the inviters are the Players.
    * Can manage the campaign adding players, master characters, maps, enemies, and much more details to the campaign module.
  
* Campaign:
    * Store the players, as the GM.
    * Store the campaign materials made available by the Game Master.
      * Maps;
      * Confronted enemies;
      * Encountered characters;
      * Visited dungeons;
